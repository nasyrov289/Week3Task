# Week 3 Task
## About Task
The Week 3 Task was:
```
Create a pom.xml in your repository (choosing a Maven project in IntelliJ should automatically do this for you), and add the dependency for Hibernate â€“ org.hibernate:hibernate-core:<version>. Find a way to test your new dependency.

Add ORM mapping for your local database from last week, test and ensure that you can access, add, change and delete records in your database through Hibernate.

Push the code to your remote repository.
```
In the process of creating connection with Database and Java Pojo classes I used Hibernate ORM. I added dependencies in hibernate.cfg.xml file. I created Test.java file to add columns and tables in my database.
